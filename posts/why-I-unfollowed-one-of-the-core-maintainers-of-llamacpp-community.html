    <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/slaren/" target="_blank">slaren</a> is one of the core maintainers of llama.cpp community. he is one of the original authors of llama.cpp, he is a truly AI expert and modern C++ master. he helped me 3 times in the llama.cpp community and I'll never forget his help to me in the llama.cpp community. apparently, I was one of his fans/followers when I falled in love with llama.cpp community since 03/2024. why I unfollowed him on 05/28/2025?
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> I personally think his's behaviour on 05/27/2025 was inappropriate and he is not a qualified leader: as a core maintainer of the llama.cpp community, you can't support/encourage the CCP style's behaviour, you should respect the rule-based order and respect the IPR, or at least you don't have any position in that long-term story/conflict.</li>
        <li> accordingly, you can't thought/think/blame/criticize/accuse Chinese or China's maintainers for stealing the US's IPR(I personally don't think that's the fact because China has many many genius/talented STEM experts) while you support/encourage the CCP style behaviour. this is undoubtedly a double-standard.</li>
        <li> apprently, say the beautifu words <i>"Collaborative feedback helps us all build better software. By sharing insights about implementation approaches, performance considerations, and edge cases, we collectively create more reliable and efficient code than any individual contributor could achieve independently."</i> and take the opposite action, is also a typical CCP style behaviour or double-standard. if you support/encourage this behaviour, don't surprise that one day China will win all the competitors, that's your choice.
        <li> I have a friend whom has very very good English and technical skills(except for AI skills), accordingly he has many many followers/fans and I also was his fan. I helped him in 2019 and he "helped" me in the 2021. unfortunately, I blocked this person on my personal wechat since 09/2023 although I felt a little sad at the time(he has very good English and tech skills and many followers, one more thing, I think he is also a good people: (1) I personally think my career was destroyed by this highly-skilled programmer(of course, I know he has different thoughts on that thing). (2) I suddenly found that <b>our values are so different</b>(for example, this person is a victim of the CCP's policiy but it seems that he is a fan of the CCP --- I'm not sure whether he is a member of the CCP at the moment). </li>
        <li> I wouldn't have wasted money and time in the github community if I had decided to join the CCP in the recent years: I paid the price for my values. I have to say that I'm not sure whether I'll stick to my values if I have another chance to choose.</li>
        <li> I have no position on China's maintainers, the reason already explained in my <a href="https://www.kantvai.com/posts/why-the-US-will-lose-in-the-competition-with-China.html" target="_blank">previous article</a>: CCP is composed of Chinese, some of them's IQ is 130+ and are proficent in English and they are also kind and gentle people. one more thing, if you studies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Ming_dynasty" target="_blank">History of the Ming dynasty</a> especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ming">History of Southern Ming Dynasty</a>(The Ming Dynasty had a population of about 0.16 billion but was <b>completely</b> defeated by a nation of only a few million people on 04/25/1644 ------ it seems there is an issue in related wiki because 05/26/1644 is probably not the correct date), you will find that the CCP is sutiable for China and <b>vast majority</b> of Chinese people: attention, the CCP is composed of Chinese; or in other words, the CCP is better than many others although you are not the fan of it or you don't agree with some of it's ideas.</li>
        <li> I have to say that I went through very hard/tough/difficult durations in China, but I still think China is a great country and there are many many kind-heart people in China.</li>
        <li> why I'm a <b>truly fan</b> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_Jun" target="_blank">Lei Jun</a>(whom was one of the China's top and legendary programmers in 1990s), one of the most important reasons is that Lei Jun is not a member of CCP although he can joined the CCP and gain more benifits accordingly. one more thing, Lei Jun is another good/typical example to demostrate we can't agree on everything: in today's China, many people support Lei Jun and many people blame/accuse/attack Lei Jun at the same time(they claims that Lei Jun/Xiaomi is an ally of the US/Qualcomm to suppress China's most powerful (state-owned?) IT giant Huawei. I personally don't think it's fact because there are too much complicated factors in that thing and I personally think that you don't understand the real China if you agree with that statement).</li>
        <li> I know Huawei is considered as the US's No.1 strategic competitor, why I'm also a <b>truly fan</b> of China's most powerful IT giant Huawei: (1) as a Linux programmer, I have to say that Huawei did really good job/excellent contributions in China's system-software-industry. I personally think Huawei = Google + Microsoft + Qualcomm + Nvidia + AWS + .... as a Chinese programmer, I'm glad to see there is such a powerful IT company in China. (2) some of my classmates/friends worked/works for Huawei, that's it.</li>
        <li> as I described in my <a href="https://www.kantvai.com/posts/why-the-highly-skilled-Dr.He-did-not-receive-widespread-support.html" target_"_blank">previous article</a>:"<i>No one stopped Dr.He's R&D activity, but he seems to still have no understand of what he did wrong. In the fact, if Dr.He had genuinely made a <b>breakthrough</b> contribution to society and humanity that was valuable and <b>compliant</b>, everyone(including the original authors of gene editing technology) would be happy to see and utilize/leverage his breakthrough contribution</i>". accordingly, China will undoubtedly win the all competitors if some very influential people support the CCP's style behaviour. I'm Chinese and I love my country(I personally think China != CCP because China has a population of 1.4 billion and there are only about 0.1 billion CCP members and many of them doesn't have strong faith on the CCP's ideas).  and I'm glad to see that result although I have no position on the China's current maintainers.</li>
        <li> we all know/understand that we can't agree on everything, accordingly, you can support CCP style behaviour, I can unfollow you although you are a truly AI expert and mordern C++ master and helped me 3 times in the llama.cpp community, one more thing, we all know that you have the power to decide whether a PR can be approved in the llama.cpp community.</li>
