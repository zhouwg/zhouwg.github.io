    <ul>
        <li> education: China's education system is very solid although it may lack of flexibility. Knowledge changes fate or reading can change one's destiny, this has been one of the values that the vast majority of Chinese people have believed in for thousands of years. </li>

        <li> human resource: China has a population of 1.4 billion and 0.26 billion of them have received an universtiy eduation. apparently <b>there are many STEM genius in China</b>. in the fact, <b>there are many individuals of Chinese or Asian descent including ABCs(American-born Chinese) work in the top US companies</b>.</li>

        <li> arrogant: some core maintainers of the US don't understand China and China's history. they can't understand that the CCP is composed of Chinese, some of them's IQ is 130+ and are proficent in English and they are also kind and gentle people. one more thing, if some core maintainers of the US studies of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Ming_dynasty" target="_blank">History of the Ming dynasty</a> especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ming">History of Southern Ming Dynasty</a>(The Ming Dynasty had a population of about 0.16 billion but was <b>completely</b> defeated by a nation of only a few million people on 04/25/1644 ------ it seems there is an issue in related wiki because 05/26/1644 is probably not the correct date), they will find that the CCP is sutiable for China and <b>vast majority</b> of Chinese people: attention, the CCP is composed of Chinese.</li>

        <li> double-standard: blame/criticize the CCP, envy and support the unique and powerful power/position of the CCP(that's what the current US administration did and it's already damage/destroy the US's soft power) or support the CCP style behaviour at the same time.</li>

        <li> lack of empathy: everyone has his/her emotion regardless of he/she is strong/rich/highly-skilled or weak/poor/low-skilled.</li>

        <li> human emotion: we all know/understand that we can't agree on everything. accordingly, you can't blame/criticize a Chinese support China's most powerful company while you support the CCP style behaviour, you can't blame/criticize China for stealing the US's IPR(I personally don't think that's the fact because China has many many genius/talented STEM experts) while you envy/support the CCP style behaviour.

        <li> common sense: as well known, the most effective way of MAGA is that the US build itself more better and stick to its traditional/treasure/good values rather than beautiful PPT or words, this will attract more followers, in the fact, this is one of the key-secrets of China's rise(or Make China Great Again --- China was the No.1 superpower before the Qing Dynasty). unfortunately / in the fact, we all can see that the US is decline and the US's behaviour is similar to China's maintainers more and more in recent years. at the same time, China is stronger and stronger and China's soft power is more attractive since 2020(I'm not sure but the maintainers/goverment said to us everyday) although there are both many tough/unpleasant problems in both two countries.</li>
       </ul>

        I'm a Chinese and I love China(although I went though some tough/hard durations/times in China). at the same time, I hope China and the US can be friends again: China and the US can work together to solve many hard-to-slove problems on our planet.
